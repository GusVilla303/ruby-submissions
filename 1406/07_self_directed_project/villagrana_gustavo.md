### Title -- Idea #1

  "Restaurant Site Locator"

<!-- [If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here] -->

#### Pitch

This app will help potential restaurateurs identify specific areas that could provide them with the best opportunity to establish a new restaurant based on research for "Household Income", "Race" and other "Household Spending Habits"

#### Description

A user (prospective restaurateur) can log in using their Facebook account to do research for a site location based on specific criteria.  For example, if I wish to open a new "Mexican" restaurant, I would log in and start looking at different locations around the city to find the areas that can give me the best chance of establishing a successful business.  

My search would start by looking at areas that are *not* over-saturated with other "Mexican" restaurants. (Maybe implement an API from YELP to produce visual results).  Next, I would also want to pull in data from the U.S. Census Bureau regarding an area's median or average Household Income to ensure that my customers would be able/willing to afford going out to eat at least once per week.


#### Target Audience

My target audience could be one of two people:

1)  First-time restaurateur seeking information to make the best decision possible regarding location.

2)  Seasoned business person looking to establish a new location site to maximize profit potential.

#### Integrations

* In order to implement OAuth, Facebook makes the most sense for this app.
* U.S. Census Bureau for household income, race & ethnicity, and spending habits
* Yelp API to identify areas where competitors *do not* exist


### Title -- Idea #2

  "Sole Connection"

<!-- [If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here] -->

#### Pitch

Sole Connection is a web app that allows registered users to buy, sell or search for "limited edition" or "highly sought after" pairs of sneakers.  



#### Description

A user can register with the app using their Twitter account given that limited releases of sneakers are already done via Twitter.  

A user can act as a buyer or 'reseller' of sneaker items.  

This would be not only an interactive platform between buyers and sellers but it would also serve simply as an informational resource where people could keep up with the latest sneaker news, trends and prices.  



#### Target Audience

Any person of any age that considers themselves to be a "sneaker collector" (aka - a sneaker head).  



#### Integrations

* OAuth will be implemented using Twitter
* I might be able to used the U.S. Census Bureau to help identify 'income' and 'spending habits' of certain households in certain areas.  
* I might look into utilizing an API from eBay and other similar sites to bring in additional comparative data for my buyer or seller.  


### Title -- Idea #3

  "Meals on Wheels"

<!-- [If this project gets selected, put **SELECTED** here] -->

#### Pitch

This app helps identify specific demographical areas where residents are living at or below poverty levels and would essentially help deliver food, canned goods, and hold "mobile food banks" or "mobile food drives" in those specified areas.  

#### Description

This application could used as an organizational platform as well as an informational outlet.  

Users would be able to log in, provide personal contact information such as an email address or user their twitter account (OAuth will use their twitter account) in order to receive updates regarding our mobile food bank and mobile food drive events.  

The application could access the U.S. Census Bureau to identify areas where people need the most help.  

The application would also be able to send out information tweets (via Twitter) as reminders of locations and events taking place at any given time.

Another 'nice to have' feature would be if I can implement google maps to help volunteers get locations and directions to different events.

Finally, the app might tap into a weather app to advise volunteers of any weather conditions that they need to be aware of.  

#### Target Audience

My target audience is made of up people who wish to volunteer at any of the mobile food bank or mobile food drive events.  



#### Integrations

* OAuth will be used with Twitter accounts
* U.S. Census Bureau will be used to identify specific demographical areas in need of our services
* Use google maps to help volunteers with locations
* Possibly a weather API to advise volunteers of any weather situations that could affect our events.
